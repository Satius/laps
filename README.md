Minimalistic indicators project with neglectible memory and cpu footprint, written in pure C. Currently includes configurable indicators for battery, sound volume, bluetooth and WiFi signal level. Builds into a single binary without any additional files. Core depends only on libx11. Sound volume indicator depends on libasound and is based upon ALSA. WiFi indicator depends on libdbus-1 and requires NetworkManager daemon.
